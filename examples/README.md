# Bad Examples

As well as the examples used in the slides, at the end of the session learners are given a selection of visualisations and asked to discuss with each other what makes them bad or misleading. Some of these were submitted by undergraduate students on the Introduction to Data Science course at the University of Edinburgh.

A list of all external examples with their original sources are included below. Where an example is openly licensed, so can be reused even outside education contexts, this is specified.
